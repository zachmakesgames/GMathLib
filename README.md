# GMathLib
### A simple math library for 3D games.

Vector and matrix math are ubiquitous in 2D and 3D games. Nearly every
detail in a game is represented mathemeatically by a vector or a matrix.
There are much better libraries that are easier to use than this one,
however with software engineering it can often be very beneficial to
create custom implementations.
